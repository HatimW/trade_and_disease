from campaigns in the Near East brought back a new disease. Known as the Antonine Plague, it killed millions (including Emperor Marcus Aurelius) and weakened Rome\u2019s military and economy. Some evidence suggests the disease may have originated in Han China and traveled west along trade routes.","The first recorded pandemic of bubonic plague erupted under Emperor Justinian. The disease\u2019s means of transmission was the black rat, which traveled on grain ships from Egypt to Constantinople. The plague killed up to half the population of affected cities and recurred for two centuries, crippling the Eastern Roman (Byzantine) Empire\u2019s economy and military.","In 1346, Mongol forces besieging the Genoese trading post of Kaffa (Crimea) catapulted plague\u2010infected corpses over the walls\u2014a notorious act of biological warfare. The terrified Italian merchants fled by ship back to Europe, unwittingly carrying Yersinia pestis with them. This event is believed to have ignited the Black Death in Europe, as epidemics followed the trade routes from Kaffa.","The Black Death (bubonic plague) swept from Asia to Europe in the mid-14th century, following the paths of trade. Originating likely in Central Asia, the plague traveled westward via Silk Road caravan routes and aboard merchant ships. By 1347 it reached Mediterranean ports and within a few years killed up to one-third of Europe\u2019s population.","The 14th-century Black Death devastated Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, but largely bypassed Sub-Saharan Africa. Although trans-Saharan caravan routes existed, contemporary evidence suggests only sporadic plague outbreaks in West African trade centers. Geographic barriers and lower urban density may have prevented the pandemic from penetrating further south.","The devastation of plague led Venetian authorities to implement one of the earliest public health interventions: quarantine. Beginning in 1377 at Ragusa (Dubrovnik) and soon adopted in Venice, ships and travelers from plague-affected areas were isolated for 40 days before entry. This 'quarantino' helped slow the spread of disease via maritime trade and became a model for epidemic control.","Increased trade and travel along Silk Road corridors spread smallpox to East Asia. Historical records show that smallpox reached Japan around the 6th century, following contact with merchants from China and Korea. The introduction of this new disease caused severe outbreaks in Japan\u2019s previously unexposed population.","After smallpox became endemic in Asia, it was carried into Africa through Arab expansion and Trans-Saharan caravan trade. By the 7th century, Islamic armies and traders spread smallpox into North Africa, and subsequently into parts of West Africa. New populations without prior exposure suffered high mortality as the virus took hold along trade and conquest routes.","The movement of large armies and pilgrims during the Crusades facilitated the spread of infections between the Middle East and Europe. For example, smallpox spread further in Europe as crusaders returning from the Holy Land carried the virus home. The Crusades helped turn local outbreaks into wider epidemics by breaching geographical disease barriers that had existed.","Soon after Columbus\u2019s voyages, syphilis erupted in Europe in 1495. The sudden appearance of this new sexually transmitted disease\u2014which many believed was brought from the Americas by returning sailors\u2014caused a major epidemic known as the 'Great Pox.' The 1495 syphilis outbreak in Naples swept across Europe within a few years, illustrating how exploration and the Columbian Exchange introduced novel pathogens across the ocean.","After 1492, smallpox, measles, and other Old World diseases traveled with European colonists and African slaves to the Americas. Lacking immunity, indigenous populations suffered catastrophic mortality. For example, smallpox introduced during the Spanish conquest caused the fall of the Aztec and Inca Empires, as epidemics in the 1520s killed a large share of those empires\u2019 inhabitants.","The yellow fever virus, endemic in West Africa, was introduced to the Western Hemisphere through the trans-Atlantic slave trade. Beginning in the 1600s, ships carrying enslaved Africans (and Aedes aegypti mosquitoes) brought yellow fever to port cities in the Caribbean and Americas. The virus found favorable ecological conditions and established a permanent cycle, leading to recurring outbreaks.","Along with people, the slave trade brought Plasmodium falciparum malaria to the Americas. Enslaved Africans carried the parasite, and regions with competent Anopheles mosquitoes saw the disease become entrenched. By the 18th century, malaria had spread throughout Latin America and the American South, causing widespread illness and death.","In the era of the Atlantic slave trade and European coastal commerce, West Africa was nicknamed the 'White Man\u2019s Grave.' Malaria and yellow fever were rampant in the region, and newly arrived Europeans often succumbed to these diseases. These barriers confined Europeans to coastal forts and shaped colonial practices.","In 1793, Philadelphia\u2014then the U.S. capital and a major port\u2014was devastated by a yellow fever outbreak. The disease likely arrived via a ship from the Caribbean (during the Haitian Revolution) carrying infected mosquitoes or refugees. Approximately 10% of the city's population died, and commerce ground to a halt as thousands fled. The epidemic spurred some of the first organized public health responses in America.","Cholera first erupted out of its Ganges Delta (India) heartland in 1817 and spread globally via expanding colonial trade networks. British troop movements and shipping carried cholera east to Southeast Asia and as far as China and Japan, and west to the Middle East. This First Cholera Pandemic introduced the disease to many regions for the first time and marked cholera\u2019s emergence as a worldwide threat.","Subsequent cholera pandemics followed steamship and railway routes into Europe and the Americas. For instance, during the Second Pandemic, cholera traveled via Russian troops and British ships into Europe, then across the Atlantic with Irish emigrants and other travelers. Cholera struck port cities like London, Hamburg, New York, and Montreal in the early 1830s, often bypassing traditional quarantine barriers.","The 1832 cholera pandemic followed new transportation routes into the interior of North America. After ships carried cholera to New York City, the disease swept up the Hudson River and along the Erie Canal, which had opened just years prior. Canal towns in upstate New York and the Great Lakes saw lethal outbreaks as canal boats and their crews carried the infection inland, magnifying the reach of the epidemic.","In 1875, Fiji suffered a disastrous measles epidemic after its King Cakobau contracted the disease in Sydney. The virus spread rapidly upon his return, sweeping through the islands and causing catastrophic mortality due to the population\u2019s lack of prior immunity.","The French attempt to construct a canal across Panama (1881\u20131889) was devastated by tropical diseases. Thousands of workers died from yellow fever and malaria in the canal zone, as limited knowledge of mosquito transmission led to uncontrolled outbreaks. This failure demonstrated how infectious disease could thwart even strategic trade projects.","A rinderpest (cattle plague) virus introduced by Italian military campaigns in East Africa in 1887 triggered one of the deadliest livestock pandemics in African history. Carried by cattle along pastoral trade routes, rinderpest killed over 90% of domestic cattle and wild ungulates in many regions, leading to the Great Ethiopian Famine (1888\u20131892) and paving the way for European colonial conquest by weakening African societies.","In 1881, Cuban physician Carlos Finlay hypothesized that mosquitoes transmit yellow fever\u2014a breakthrough observation from Havana outbreaks. Although initially met with skepticism, Walter Reed\u2019s commission later confirmed the theory in 1900, leading to effective mosquito-control efforts that protected port cities and facilitated projects like the Panama Canal.","The third plague pandemic began in China (notably in Yunnan and Hong Kong) and spread rapidly with the advent of steamships. Plague-infected rats stowed away on ships, leading to major outbreaks in port cities across five continents, including in India, Cape Town, and San Francisco.","In 1902, following repeated yellow fever and cholera epidemics, governments from 11 countries in the Americas formed the Pan American Sanitary Bureau. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., it was the first international health organization aimed at improving quarantine and disease control cooperation across the hemisphere.","U.S. Army doctor William C. Gorgas led a public health campaign during the construction of the Panama Canal. His measures\u2014drainage, fumigation, and patient isolation\u2014eliminated yellow fever and drastically reduced malaria, enabling the canal's completion by 1914.","The 1918 'Spanish Flu' pandemic was accelerated by massive troop movements during World War I. The virus spread rapidly via shipping and rail networks, ultimately killing an estimated 50 million people worldwide.","The advent of commercial air travel enabled influenza to spread faster than ever. The 1957 'Asian Flu' and 1968 'Hong Kong Flu' pandemics circled the globe within months, illustrating how modern air travel could transport new strains to distant continents before local outbreaks were detected.","In 1972, an infected pilgrim returning from the Middle East triggered a smallpox outbreak in Yugoslavia. Swift government action\u2014including quarantine and mass vaccination\u2014contained the outbreak after 175 cases, demonstrating the efficacy of traditional public health measures in the modern era.","Smallpox, once a globally pervasive disease, became the first human disease eradicated through an international vaccination program led by the WHO. The last naturally occurring case was recorded in 1977, marking a historic triumph in global public health.","The HIV/AIDS pandemic illustrates how increased global mobility can disseminate pathogens before they are recognized. Emerging in Central Africa, HIV spread along travel and migration routes to Haiti and the United States in the 1970s, and by the 1980s, international air travel had seeded the virus in major cities, sparking a global health crisis.","Global commerce in used tires and other goods inadvertently spread disease vectors to new regions. The Asian tiger mosquito (Aedes albopictus), a carrier of dengue and chikungunya, was transported to the Americas and Europe in shipments of used tires during the 1980s. Mosquitoes have also hitchhiked on ships and airplanes, establishing new habitats for arboviruses.","In 1991, cholera resurfaced in South America after a century\u2019s absence. A new strain of Vibrio cholerae appeared in coastal Peru, likely introduced by contaminated ballast water from an Asian freighter, and quickly swept through the region, causing over 1 million cases across Latin America.","The SARS outbreak of 2003 demonstrated how quickly a virus could spread in the age of air travel. Originating in Guangdong, China, one infected doctor in Hong Kong led to over 8,000 cases across 26 countries, prompting global travel advisories and quarantine measures that eventually contained the outbreak.","In 2009, a novel H1N1 influenza virus emerged in Mexico and spread rapidly around the world via air travel. Cases were reported on every continent within two months, underscoring the role of modern air travel in disseminating new flu strains, even though the illness was relatively mild for most.","The emergence of MERS-CoV in 2012 raised concerns over disease spread during the Hajj. Saudi authorities urged high-risk individuals to postpone pilgrimage, and heightened surveillance prevented a major outbreak beyond a few travel-related cases.","In 2014, an acutely ill man flew from Ebola-stricken Liberia to Lagos, Nigeria. His collapse at the airport triggered swift containment measures that limited the outbreak to 20 cases, preventing a larger epidemic in Africa\u2019s largest city.","In early 2020, COVID-19 spread rapidly via international air travel, leading the WHO to declare a pandemic on March 11, 2020. The outbreak prompted unprecedented travel restrictions and lockdowns, highlighting the vulnerabilities of global connectivity.","Starting in 1851, international conferences in Paris and elsewhere established quarantine standards and maritime regulations to combat the spread of cholera, plague, and yellow fever along global trade routes, marking early efforts in global health diplomacy.","UNICEF has been a key partner in the Global Polio Eradication Initiative, delivering vaccines via air and road routes to remote regions, even in conflict zones, thereby playing a crucial role in reducing polio incidence worldwide.","In response to the Ebola outbreak, over 60 countries launched the Global Health Security Agenda to strengthen capacities for preventing, detecting, and responding to infectious disease threats, showcasing modern international collaboration in public health security.","As Arab merchants and Islamic empires expanded through North Africa, smallpox traveled via camel caravans into West Africa along trans-Saharan trade routes. The disease became endemic in trade cities like Timbuktu and Gao. Populations without prior exposure suffered severe outbreaks, marking one of the earliest examples of trade-driven disease diffusion in Sub-Saharan Africa."],"shape":[41],"dtype":"object","order":"little"}],["Latitude",{"type":"ndarray","array":{"type":"bytes","data":"MzMzMzPzREDNzMzMzIxEQMP1KFyPgkZA9ihcj8LVRECF61G4HsUwQLgehetRuEZA4XoUrkeBQUCF61G4HkUwQNejcD0Kd0BAzczMzMxsRECuR+F6FG4zQFyPwvUoHDdAMzMzMzOzPkBI4XoUrscsQJqZmZmZ+UNAUrgeheuRNkAAAAAAAMBJQBSuR+F6lEVApHA9CtcjMsBmZmZmZuYhQPYoXI/C9SFAXI/C9SgcN0DNzMzMzEw2QDMzMzMzc0NA9ihcj8L1IUDNzMzMzGxIQJqZmZmZmfU/SOF6FK5nRkCamZmZmRlHQHsUrkfhWkRAmpmZmZmZ9T+amZmZmRkowFK4HoXrUTZArkfhehRuM0DsUbgehWs1QM3MzMzMzBlAmpmZmZkZR0DNzMzMzGxIQFyPwvUonDxAAAAAAADgQEAAAAAAAAAvQA=="},"shape":[41],"dtype":"float64","order":"little"}],["Longitude",{"type":"ndarray","array":{"type":"bytes","data":"AAAAAAAAKUCamZmZmRk9QDMzMzMzM0FAUrgeheuROkAAAAAAAAAIwClcj8L1qChAAAAAAAD4YEAAAAAAAAAAAArXo3A9ikFACtejcD2KLEC4HoXrUchYwNejcD0Kl1TAw/UoXI8CVsC4HoXrUXgxwHsUrkfhylLA16NwPQoXVkC4HoXrUbi+v9ejcD0KZ1PAPQrXo3BNZkAAAAAAAOBTwOF6FK5HYUNA16NwPQqXVMB7FK5H4YpcQFK4HoXrQVPAUrgehevhU8DNzMzMzMwCQBSuR+F69FlA9ihcj8J1NECPwvUoXI8YQAAAAAAAgFLAFK5H4Xr0WUAzMzMzM0NTwHsUrkfhilxAAAAAAADAWMAK16NwPepDQB+F61G4HgtAMzMzMzMzGUAzMzMzMzMDQM3MzMzMTFNAKVyPwvUYVcAAAAAAAAAEwA=="},"shape":[41],"dtype":"float64","order":"little"}],["fill_color",{"type":"ndarray","array":["red","red","red","red","blue","green","blue","red","red","blue","red","blue","blue","blue","red","red","red","red","blue","red","red","purple","red","purple","purple","red","red","green","purple","red","blue","red","green","red","green","green","purple","green","purple","green","red"],"shape":[41],"dtype":"object","order":"little"}]]}}},"view":{"type":"object","name":"CDSView","id":"p1194","attributes":{"filter":{"type":"object","name":"AllIndices","id":"p1195"}}},"glyph":{"type":"object","name":"Scatter","id":"p1190","attributes":{"x":{"type":"field","field":"Longitude","transform":{"type":"object","name":"Jitter","id":"p1185","attributes":{"width":0.5,"range":{"id":"p1010"}}}},"y":{"type":"field","field":"Latitude","transform":{"type":"object","name":"Jitter","id":"p1186","attributes":{"width":0.5,"range":{"id":"p1011"}}}},"size":{"type":"value","value":12},"line_width":{"type":"value","value":2},"fill_color":{"type":"field","field":"fill_color"}}},"nonselection_glyph":{"type":"object","name":"Scatter","id":"p1191","attributes":{"x":{"type":"field","field":"Longitude","transform":{"id":"p1185"}},"y":{"type":"field","field":"Latitude","transform":{"id":"p1186"}},"size":{"type":"value","value":12},"line_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.1},"line_width":{"type":"value","value":2},"fill_color":{"type":"field","field":"fill_color"},"fill_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.1},"hatch_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.1}}},"muted_glyph":{"type":"object","name":"Scatter","id":"p1192","attributes":{"x":{"type":"field","field":"Longitude","transform":{"id":"p1185"}},"y":{"type":"field","field":"Latitude","transform":{"id":"p1186"}},"size":{"type":"value","value":12},"line_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.2},"line_width":{"type":"value","value":2},"fill_color":{"type":"field","field":"fill_color"},"fill_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.2},"hatch_alpha":{"type":"value","value":0.2}}}}},{"type":"object","name":"GlyphRenderer","id":"p1206","attributes":{"data_source":{"type":"object","name":"ColumnDataSource","id":"p1197","attributes":{"selected":{"type":"object","name":"Selection","id":"p1198","attributes":{"indices":[],"line_indices":[]}},"selection_policy":{"type":"object","name":"UnionRenderers","id":"p1199"},"data":{"type":"map","entries":[["x",[-175]],["y",[-85]],["sources",["\nSources:\n1.
